How and why did I choose to make this personal blogging website?

It's Saturday afternoon, I got a cup of coffee and turned on my computer to work on a project today. I didn't have any interesting ideas to work on ... so why not delete unnecessary files + update my website.

I opened my previous website. First impression: even though I made my previous website... it's boring to look at. There's nothing interesting. However, I was lazy to write every single html page and link it and then so on and so forth. So I decided to change things...

Yup, I felt that I needed to change my website so that it's easier to create and maintain contents on my personal website.

Then I remembered my friend, Seikun, mentioning something about Jekyll which he used to make his personal website. So with a cup of coffee, I started reading Jekyll's documentation. It takes time to get used to Jekyll's way of doing stuff, but after reading couple pages of documentation, I learned that Jekyll has an interesting and convenient features for users to create static websites. 

From now until I get back to school, I will try to write one or two blogs per month. (Let's pray that I can make at least one in every month).
