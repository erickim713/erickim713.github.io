_Tech/Tools used_: Javascript, Vue.js, Jquery, Bootstrap

With Christmas around the corner, I wanted to make a webpage that uses Vue.js. Making a webpage for a cafe that I go to almost everyday sounded fun. So I started making a webpage that is simple yet displays information relevant to the cafe such as menu, opening hours. (As I am writing this, I realized that I should have put location as well...). 

I was always not so good with the design especially with the fancy flashy ones. So I tried to make a simple yet cool looking User Interface. I used jquery, vue.js and vanilla javacript to make all the components. 

I used github pages to host this project.

What have I learned:
* Vue.js, responsive design, bootstrap, jquery, github-pages

Repo:
* [Kokiri Cafè](https://github.com/erickim713/kokiri)
