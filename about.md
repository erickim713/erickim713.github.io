Hello! I am HyungWoo Kim (You can also call me Eric). 

Currently, I am taking a semester off from [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html) and working on small side projects for fun.

I was born in Korea but I moved to U.S and finished 4-12 grades. I moved back to Korea to study computer science in KAIST Computer Science Department. So far, I had the priviledge to intern at [GigaVis](http://gigavis.com/kor/), [SK Hynix](https://www.skhynix.com/eng/index.jsp), and [KAIST Interaction Lab](https://kixlab.org/). Current academic interests are: data visualization and HCI (Human Computer Interaction)

I am a student, developer, and gamer (love competitive gaming). Currently, I am loving [Playerunknown's Battlegrounds](https://playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu).
