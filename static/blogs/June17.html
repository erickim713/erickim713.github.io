    <h2>Graduation Picture</h2>
</div>

<div class="usual-paragraph">
    Yes, I have completed my 4th year at KAIST. However, I still have not taken the required number of credits(130) to graduate KAIST; therefore, I am still not a KAIST graduate. I will be just considered
	<i>yeoncha cho-ga-jwa</i> (연차초과자) because I went over the time limit that KAIST covers the tuition. My friends and I took the graduation photos beginning of June, it was so hot
	that wearing those suits almost killed us. I have enjoyed my times at KAIST with these guys. To introduce them from left to right: KyungJe Jo, Mr.Idon'tknowwho, Jason Cho, HyunSung Cho,
	Tony Kim, Me!, and lastly, Sunmin Son. I was able to survive the four grueling years at KAIST because their help. I was totally new to the computer science field; yet, with their help,
	I was able to become who I am now.

    <h2>Final Exams</h2>
</div>

<div class="usual-paragraph">
    Of course, it's the final's exam week (our final week is basically two weeks since we have one week is for humanity courses and another week is for major exams). Speding time to study
	daily is almost coming to an end. Thankfully, I only had one final exam to take this semester. Although the result of the exam was terrible, I am still satisfied that
	I don't have to take anymore official exams for college courses. I just have to finish required research and collaborative project course to take next semester, which is going to be one
	year from now on. Yes, I will tell you why it's a year from now next.

<div class="sub-title">
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
</div>

<div class="usual-paragraph">
    I have decided to take <b>a semester</b> off from school. This means that I will have time from now... till beginning of March of 2018. The reason I have decided to take a semester off
	is pretty straight forward. I needed a break; I was burned out from due dates and assignments. I wanted to do my own studies that I am interested in. It's not that all of the things I studied were topics that
	I didn't want to learn at school. For now, I am planning on training myself to become a full stack developer. Why full stack developer? I am interested in human computer interaction field (I am not sure which specific topic yet..)
	and to study HCI (or any other field, I assume) effectively, I realized that being able to code up a prototype was essential. Therefore, I decided to cover both frontend and backend. This semester truly taught me a lot of life and work lessons. I thank my research
	advisor Juho Kim for an invaluable experience.
